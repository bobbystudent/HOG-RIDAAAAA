Story: You wake up in a cozy, ominously glowing field of golden flowers.
Your head hurts.
A tiny talking flower smiles at you. It’s unsettling.

“Howdy! I’m Flowbee the Definitely-Friendly-Not-Evil Flower!”

He waves his leaf at you, and somehow it smells like trouble.

🌸 CHOICE 1:

A. Smile back politely.
B. Step on him.
C. Ask him if he’s the final boss.

If you chose A (Smile back politely):

Flowbee grins wider — too wide.

“You’re new to the Underground, aren’tcha? Well, in this world, it’ BEAT or BE BEATEN!”

He starts shooting small bullets made of pure friendship (definitely not murder).

You panic!

A. Dodge dramatically like an anime protagonist.
B. Accept your fate.
C. Use the ancient human technique: running away screaming.

If you chose B (Step on him):

You stomp him.
He lets out an “ow” that sounds suspiciously sarcastic.

“RUDE. You’re gonna have a bad thyme later.”

He disappears into the dirt with a giggle. Somewhere in the distance, a skeleton sneezes.

Proceed to Section: Spaghetti Encounter. 🍝

If you chose C (Ask if he’s the final boss):

“What? No! Why does everyone assume that?! Do I look like I have final boss energy?!”
He storms off muttering about therapy bills.
